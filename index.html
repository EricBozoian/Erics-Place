    <div class="about-section">
        <h3>Alias</h3>
        <p><span>Buzz</span></p>

        <h3>Life’s Summary</h3>
        <p><span>The ship has taken a beating, but no storm has yet found the strength to topple me.</span></p>

              <h3>❤️ Personal Life</h3>
        <h4>💍 Love & Partnership</h4>
        <p>💍 <span>Engaged, and soon to be wed, on the fifteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord, 2025. A new chapter, a new adventure, and a love that will not falter.</span></p>

        <h3>📍 Hometown & Travels</h3>
        <p>🏡 <span>Born in Manchester, NH.</span></p>
        <p>📍 <span>Lives in Nashua, NH.</span></p>
        <p>🧳 <span>Has wandered far and wide across this great land, led by duty, by work, and by an insatiable need to see what lies beyond the next horizon.</span></p>

        <h3>👨‍💼 Occupation(s)</h3>
        <p>💼 <span>By day, a federal servant, navigating the grand and often perplexing machinery of government.</span></p>
        <p>🏐 <span>By night, a purveyor of sport, a keeper of the court, hosting volleyball tournaments where fierce competition and grand camaraderie intertwine.</span></p>

        <h3>🎯 Hobbies & Passions</h3>
        <h4>🏐 The Court & The Climb</h4>
        <p>🏐 <span>Volleyball—where power and precision meet, where battles are fought not with swords, but with skill.</span></p>
        <p>🥾 <span>Hiking—where the soul is measured in footsteps, and each summit is a triumph over the self.</span></p>

        <h4>💎 The Stones & The Stars</h4>
        <p>💎 <span>A man of stone—no, not in heart, but in hand. I cut, I carve, I shape gems, turning the rough into the refined.</span></p>
        <p>🔬 <span>A tinkerer, a maker, forever chasing knowledge, whether in books, in machines, or in the steady hum of creation itself.</span></p>

        <h4>📚 The Written Word</h4>
        <p>📚 <span>Philosophy, history, tales of wonder—I devour them all, for the mind, like a blade, must be sharpened lest it grow dull.</span></p>

        <h4>🎬 The Silver Screen</h4>
        <p>🎬 <span>Horror, action, sci-fi—stories where the impossible is made real, and reality itself is stretched to its very limits.</span></p>

        <h3>⚖️ Beliefs & Ideals</h3>
        <h4>🔴 Politics & Principles</h4>
        <p>🔴 <span>Far left, some might say, though I simply stand where fairness and justice demand.</span></p>
        <p>✝️ <span>Religious, but not in the way men of power prefer—my faith is in giving, in lifting others, in love without condition.</span></p>

        <h4>📢 Causes Close to My Heart</h4>
        <p>💰 <span>Economic equality—where wealth does not dictate worth.</span></p>
        <p>👷 <span>Labor rights—for a man’s toil should not leave him broken.</span></p>
        <p>🌎 <span>The environment—a world given, not owned, and never to be squandered.</span></p>
        <p>⚖️ <span>Social justice—for the chains of oppression must be shattered, one link at a time.</span></p>

        <h4>💻 The Modern Age & The Machine</h4>
        <p>💻 <span>Tech-savvy, some say—a wielder of code, an architect of data, a whisperer of Excel’s arcane arts.</span></p>
        <p>🖥️ <span>HTML, Java, CSS—languages of the new world, and I have learned to speak them well.</span></p>

        <h4>⏳ Daily Habits & Oddities</h4>
        <p>🌙 <span>A night owl—when the world sleeps, I wake, for the dark is where thoughts run deepest.</span></p>
        <p>🌊 <span>A lover of the sea—if heaven were a place, it would have sand beneath my feet and the tide at my heels.</span></p>

        <h4>🐈 Feline Companions</h4>
        <p>🐈 <span>Mimi & Lulu—small in stature, great in spirit, and masters of my heart, whether I admit it or not.</span></p>
       <h3>📜 Favorite quotes</h3>
        <p><span>When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.  </span></p>
        <p> <span>Never look down on someone unless you are helping them up.</span></p>
        <p><span>"Numbers don't lie. But sometimes liars use numbers." - Herman Cain</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>n our culture we’ve been trained for individual differences to stand out. So you look at each person and immediately you think brighter, dumber, older, younger, richer, poorer, and we make all these dimensional distinctions, put them into categories and treat them that way. And we get so we only see others as separate from ourselves and the ways in which they’re separate. And one of the dramatic characteristics of experience is being with another person and suddenly seeing the ways they are like you, not different from you. And experiencing the fact that that which is essence in you, and is essence in you, is indeed one. The understanding that there is no other. It is all one.</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~Sometimes I would like to ask God why He allows poverty, suffering, and injustice when he could do something about it. But I’m afraid He would ask me the same question. – Anonymous.</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~Its called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it. - George Carlin</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~Cowards Die many times before there deaths, but the valiant only taste of death but once...</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>They wished him to be thought atheist, deist, or devil, who could advocate freedom from their religious dictations. But I have ever thought religion a concern purely between our God and our consciences, for which we were accountable to him, and not to the priests. I never told my own religion, nor scrutinized that of another. I never attempted to make a convert, nor wished to change another's creed. I have ever judged of the religion of others by their lives, and by this test, my dear Madam, I have been satisfied yours must be an excellent one, to have produced a life of such exemplary virtue and correctness. For it is in our lives, and not from our words, that our religion must be read. By the same test the world must judge me. But this does not satisfy the priesthood. They must have a positive, a declared assent to all their interested absurdities. My opinion is that there would never have been an infidel, if there had never been a priest.  -Thomas Jefferson 1816</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~"all men ...have in them the physical power to raise themselves up to the highest ideas...the difference in intellect which we observe among them depend on the different circumstances in which they find themselves placed, and the different education which they receive." -Claude Adrien Helvetius </span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>We need to starve that beast (the government) of all its funds so when those damn democrats get into power they won't be able to do any of those silly things like promoting human happiness - Dr. Simon Perry on Republican Governing</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>Money has invaded every sphere of life and has become a silent tyranny. There are many things that money should not buy. Money should not buy elections. Money should not buy political appointments. Money should not buy education. Money should not buy health care. Money should not buy honor. Money should not buy marriage. And finally money should not buy entry into heaven.
-Dr. Simon Perry</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~You cannot lead where others are not willing to follow. 
-Angulo, Raul A.</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~Live Free or Die!</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~ long story short, you are all wrong and I am right!</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~even when all odds are against you, their is still always a chance</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~all is lost for the boogies are to many and the tissues are too few!</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~the strength to endure, and the will to see it though.</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>Fidelis Ad Mortem</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>“In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>Cast your burden on the lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved. 
psalm 55:22</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death.
-Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892--1950)</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>When I was hungry, you gave me something to eat, and when I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink. When I was a stranger, you welcomed me, and when I was naked, you gave me clothes to wear. When I was sick, you took care of me, and when I was in jail, you visited me.” Then the ones who pleased the Lord will ask, “When did we give you something to eat or drink? When did we welcome you as a stranger or give you clothes to wear or visit you while you were sick or in jail?” The king will answer, “Whenever you did it for any of my people, no matter how unimportant they seemed, you did it for me.”
Matthew 25:35-45 CEV
