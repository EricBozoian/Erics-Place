        <h3>🎯 Hobbies & Passions</h3>
        <h4>🏐 The Court & The Climb</h4>
        <p>🏐 <span>Volleyball—where power and precision meet, where battles are fought not with swords, but with skill.</span></p>
        <p>🥾 <span>Hiking—where the soul is measured in footsteps, and each summit is a triumph over the self.</span></p>

        <h4>💎 The Stones & The Stars</h4>

        <h4>📢 Causes Close to My Heart</h4>
        <p>💰 <span>Economic equality—where wealth does not dictate worth.</span></p>
        <p>👷 <span>Labor rights—for a man’s toil should not leave him broken.</span></p>
        <p>🌎 <span>The environment—a world given, not owned, and never to be squandered.</span></p>
        <p>⚖️ <span>Social justice—for the chains of oppression must be shattered, one link at a time.</span></p>

        <h4>💻 The Modern Age & The Machine</h4>
        <p>💻 <span>Tech-savvy, some say—a wielder of code, an architect of data, a whisperer of Excel’s arcane arts.</span></p>
        <p>🖥️ <span>HTML, Java, CSS—languages of the new world, and I have learned to speak them well.</span></p>

        <h4>⏳ Daily Habits & Oddities</h4>
        <p>🌙 <span>A night owl—when the world sleeps, I wake, for the dark is where thoughts run deepest.</span></p>
        <p>🌊 <span>A lover of the sea—if heaven were a place, it would have sand beneath my feet and the tide at my heels.</span></p>

        <h4>🐈 Feline Companions</h4>
        <p>🐈 <span>Mimi & Lulu—small in stature, great in spirit, and masters of my heart, whether I admit it or not.</span></p>

        <p>🖋️<span>When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.  </span></p>
        <p>🖋️ <span>Never look down on someone unless you are helping them up.</span></p>
        <p>🖋️<span>"Numbers don't lie. But sometimes liars use numbers." - Herman Cain</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>in our culture we’ve been trained for individual differences to stand out. So you look at each person and immediately you think brighter, dumber, older, younger, richer, poorer, and we make all these dimensional distinctions, put them into categories and treat them that way. And we get so we only see others as separate from ourselves and the ways in which they’re separate. And one of the dramatic characteristics of experience is being with another person and suddenly seeing the ways they are like you, not different from you. And experiencing the fact that that which is essence in you, and is essence in you, is indeed one. The understanding that there is no other. It is all one.</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~Sometimes I would like to ask God why He allows poverty, suffering, and injustice when he could do something about it. But I’m afraid He would ask me the same question. – Anonymous.</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~Its called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it. - George Carlin</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~Cowards Die many times before there deaths, but the valiant only taste of death but once...</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>They wished him to be thought atheist, deist, or devil, who could advocate freedom from their religious dictations. But I have ever thought religion a concern purely between our God and our consciences, for which we were accountable to him, and not to the priests. I never told my own religion, nor scrutinized that of another. I never attempted to make a convert, nor wished to change another's creed. I have ever judged of the religion of others by their lives, and by this test, my dear Madam, I have been satisfied yours must be an excellent one, to have produced a life of such exemplary virtue and correctness. For it is in our lives, and not from our words, that our religion must be read. By the same test the world must judge me. But this does not satisfy the priesthood. They must have a positive, a declared assent to all their interested absurdities. My opinion is that there would never have been an infidel, if there had never been a priest.  -Thomas Jefferson 1816</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>~"all men ...have in them the physical power to raise themselves up to the highest ideas...the difference in intellect which we observe among them depend on the different circumstances in which they find themselves placed, and the different education which they receive." -Claude Adrien Helvetius </span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>We need to starve that beast (the government) of all its funds so when those damn democrats get into power they won't be able to do any of those silly things like promoting human happiness - Dr. Simon Perry on Republican Governing</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>Money has invaded every sphere of life and has become a silent tyranny. There are many things that money should not buy. Money should not buy elections. Money should not buy political appointments. Money should not buy education. Money should not buy health care. Money should not buy honor. Money should not buy marriage. And finally money should not buy entry into heaven.
-Dr. Simon Perry</span></p>

-Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892--1950)</span></p>
<p>🖋️<span>When I was hungry, you gave me something to eat, and when I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink. When I was a stranger, you welcomed me, and when I was naked, you gave me clothes to wear. When I was sick, you took care of me, and when I was in jail, you visited me.” Then the ones who pleased the Lord will ask, “When did we give you something to eat or drink? When did we welcome you as a stranger or give you clothes to wear or visit you while you were sick or in jail?” The king will answer, “Whenever you did it for any of my people, no matter how unimportant they seemed, you did it for me.”

       <h3 class="paper-title">Into the Digital Wilderness</h3>
       <p class="paper-date">February 1st, 2025, Saturday</p>
       <p class="paper-body">
           It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, but mostly, for our dear protagonist, Eric, it was the most bewildering of times. The vast corridors of the digital world, once bustling with the honest mirth of shared stories and the joyous reverberations of friendship, had grown tainted, darkened by an insidious hand that guided its levers toward a singular and troubling direction. And so, with a solemn heart and a firm resolve, Eric cast off his chains and strode boldly into the digital wilderness, untethered from the grand, gilded prisons of Facebook and Instagram.
       </p>
       <p class="paper-body">
           Not long ago, these spaces had been havens, little salons of thought and mirth, where one might post the portrait of a fine evening’s repast or the sun-kissed visage of a beloved friend. Yet, as the years marched on, their keepers—those grim, pale figures who knew neither loyalty nor scruple—turned their dominion into something more nefarious. Eric, a man of sense and conscience, had long suffered their manipulations, the unseen hands nudging him toward odious accounts and loathsome proclamations. On the morning after the election of one Donald J. Trump, he awoke to a discovery most grievous: his accounts, seemingly of their own will, had pledged allegiance to the very figure who embodied all he abhorred. And worse still, his feeds, those once-neutral arbiters of his friends’ musings, now bore an infestation of ideas so noxious, so steeped in a vile and regressive air, that he found himself adrift in a sea of propaganda not of his choosing.
       </p>
       <p class="paper-body">
           Thus, Eric did what few in this age of sloth and addiction dare to do: he took up his hammer, not to destroy, but to create. He built for himself a digital sanctuary, a space of his own making, untainted by the grasping hands of those who would sell his attention for their dark purposes. With Myspace-like ingenuity and the sturdy tools of RSS, he fashioned a newsfeed of his own, one where he alone held dominion over the voices that entered his domain. No more would he be subjected to the whims of the algorithm, that fickle and deceitful specter; no more would he awaken to the harrowing realization that he had been coerced into digesting the poison of the modern internet.
       </p>
       <p class="paper-body">
           And yet, this was no act of mere retreat. Nay, it was a declaration! A pronouncement against the tyranny of the digital age, a call to arms for all who would cast off their gilded shackles and reclaim their own agency. For who among us has not felt the creeping despair of an unwelcome narrative forced upon them? Who has not, at some silent hour, wondered if the world they see before them is, in truth, the world as it is, or merely a marionette show, carefully crafted to make them believe what suits the puppeteers?
       </p>
       <p class="paper-body">
           Eric bids you, dear reader, to take up this cause, to join him upon this path through the wilderness. The road will be unfamiliar, yes; the temptations of old habits will call out like sirens upon the digital shore. But to those who dare, to those who seek to reclaim the rightful freedom of their own minds, there is much to be gained. A world beyond the clutches of shadowy conglomerates, a life untethered from the silent algorithms that would mold your very thoughts.
       </p>
       <p class="paper-body">
           And so, with a final nod to what was, Eric steps forth, unburdened, into the wilds of a future that is his own to shape. Let others wallow in the fetid swamps of Facebook’s invention; let them grasp at the phantom pleasures of Instagram’s trickery. He has chosen better. He has chosen freedom. And in so doing, he has found himself anew.
